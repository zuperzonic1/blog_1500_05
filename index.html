            <p>Dall-e is an amazing machine learning model that has been extensivly been trained to convert your text prompts to facinating images, I personally think that this is amazing for designers, as it allows us to gain impressing pictures that we can edit to our own prefrence on photoshop.  </p>

            <p> The Article talks about how busisness need to put more effort and resources into using augmented reality to better inprove the information intake for their workers and customers, as there are studies that show how augmented reality can help improve productivity/ effeciency. with that bing said, I think that Augmented reality is really cool because it syncs between the real world and a piece of technology, i think it stands out more that the more known version which is Virtual reality, as it could assist you in your daily tasks & display valuable information, without teleporting into a different world.    </p>
